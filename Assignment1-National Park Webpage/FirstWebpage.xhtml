            The cone karst formation stands out from any other in the world due to the geological, biological, erosional and climatic phenomena; 
            The formation is still isn't understood by scientists. Moreover, Purnululu holds a strong integrity when it comes to preserving different species and land itself.

                <li>  While the complex geological formation of the overall park was resulted by <br/> millions of years of corrusion, scientists still can't explain how exactly the domes were formed and how they are evolving <br/> </li>
